<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Moisture Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive Soil Moisture Sensor</li><li>Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The soil moisture sensor market is primarily divided into two main types: resistive and capacitive sensors. Resistive soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture by detecting changes in electrical resistance between two probes, which can be affected by soil salinity and corrosion over time. Capacitive soil moisture sensors, on the other hand, use dielectric permittivity to measure moisture levels without direct contact with the soil, offering improved durability and accuracy. Both types serve agricultural, environmental, and gardening applications.</p></p>
